# Overview
The project focus on building a backend system that can support different feature for an airline company. Our end user will be using the services for booking and querying for flights so we need to provide them with best experience possible. We want to build the whole backend keeping in mind that the code should be neat and can be easily maintained.

## Features
* User should be able to search for flights, select class and date of journey.
* We should be able to show best possible flights to user based on its requirements.
* We should support filters of flights based on departure time, arrival time, rates.
* A user should be registered on platform for the booking of flight.
* User should be able to view their previous journey.
* Notification via email for online check-in and about flights delay.
